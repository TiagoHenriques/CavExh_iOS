# CavExh_iOS

This is an iOS application that serves as support for the "70 Cavaquinhos, 70 Artistas" exhibition. Some of the features included are the possibility to:

- see a gallery with all the cavaquinhos,
- see each object in detail, with several images of each,
- zoom in on each image, to get a more detailed view,
- get information about the exhibition authors,
- get information about the exhibition,
- sharing an image of the object to Facebook,
- add favorites,
- play a game where the user has to guess to each cavaquinho does the picture belong to.

The application was developed to be used with internet access, but it presents the user with the option to download the content so he can use it without an internet connection.
